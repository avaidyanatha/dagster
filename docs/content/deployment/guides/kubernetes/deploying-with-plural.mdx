## Overview

[Plural](https://www.plural.sh/) is a free, open-source tool that enables you to self-host Dagster on Kubernetes in one
of the big three cloud providers. It provides automated upgrades, secret encryption, and built-in DevOps workflows
with the console.

## Getting Started

First, create an account on [https://app.plural.sh](https://app.plural.sh). This is to sync your installations and allow for the delivery of automated upgrades. You will not be asked to provide any infrastructure credentials or sensitive information.

Next, install the Plural CLI by following steps 1-3 of [these instructions](https://docs.plural.sh/getting-started).

You'll need a Git repository to store your Plural configuration. This will contain the Helm charts, Terraform config, and Kubernetes manifests that Plural will autogenerate for you.

You have two options:
- Run `plural init` in any directory to let Plural initiate an OAuth workflow to create a Git repo for you.
- Create a Git repo manually, clone it down, and run `plural init` inside it.

Running `plural init` will start a configuration wizard to configure your Git repo and cloud provider for use with Plural.
